# Shooting_the_Vert

This py-game is developed in interest of the children. It adresses some important social issues as well. The main motive is that children nowadays go through a lot of stuff and may not discuss it with anyone land then make bad decisions. They need to learn some important life lessons through an exciting game!!

## How to run
Run the "main.py" file by the command - 
```python main.py```

## Rules
The child has to make a choice between two options and select the appropriate one. The child then has to shoot at two monsters available and will get a plus score on shooting at the right target and a negative score otherwise. This way they can get to know what a good choice can be :)

The two mosters are - 

1. The Vert - On shooting the green monster, the score increases by "+1"

2. The Rouge - On shooting the red monster, the score decreases by "-1"
